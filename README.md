The Impact of Handwashing in the 1800s on Reducing Mortality Rates

## Introduction

This project examines the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates in the 1800s, as discovered by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis. The dataset used in this project contains records of monthly mortality rates in two clinics (clinic 1 and clinic 2) in Vienna, Austria, during the years 1841-1848. The analysis is conducted using pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was sourced from the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine and can be accessed via Kaggle. The dataset contains monthly records of mortality rates in clinic 1 and clinic 2, as well as information about the implementation of handwashing in clinic 1.

## Analysis

The analysis in this project involves:

- Data cleaning and preparation using pandas
- Data visualization using matplotlib
- Hypothesis testing to determine the significance of handwashing in reducing mortality rates

## Conclusion

The results of the analysis indicate that the implementation of handwashing in clinic 1 led to a significant reduction in mortality rates. This project highlights the importance of hand hygiene in healthcare and the impact it can have on patient outcomes.
